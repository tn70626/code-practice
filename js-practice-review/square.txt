Task #2 - Add "{numActiveTodos} item(s) left" status in footer
- Reference image: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/t-640/todo-static.png
- The number is a count of to-dos that have not been completed.
- The positioning should be similar to the static image. It doesn’t have to be pixel perfect.


Task #3 - Add "Clear completed" button in footer
- Clicking the button removes all the completed todos.
- Button is right-aligned and vertically centered inside the footer.
- Button is ONLY VISIBLE if there are completed todos, otherwise invisible.
- Style the button so it appears the same as in the static image.
